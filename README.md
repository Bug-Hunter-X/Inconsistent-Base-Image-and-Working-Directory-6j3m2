This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile error: using `ubuntu:latest` as the base image and omitting a working directory.  The `Dockerfile` shows the problematic code, while `DockerfileFixed` provides the corrected version. The problem is that `ubuntu:latest` is not pinned to a specific version, leading to potential inconsistencies across builds.  Additionally, without a working directory, the COPY and CMD instructions may fail unpredictably. The solution involves using a specific ubuntu version (e.g., `ubuntu:22.04`) and setting a working directory using `WORKDIR`.
